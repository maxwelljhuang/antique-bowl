Project Title and Description:
 Antique Bowl is a play on the popular mobile game “Retro Bowl”. 
 Using game AI to create defenders for the user who plays as the quarterback, users can select from two play options including running the ball or passing the ball. 
 If passing the ball, the user will drag the mouse backward behind the quarterback to change speed and trajectory of the football. 
 If running the ball, the user will select the run play and the ball will be given to the running back where the user uses arrow keys to move forward and evade the defenders. 
 If the player reaches the endzone, 7 points will be awarded to the player. 
 If the player fails to reach the endzone in four tries, they lose.
